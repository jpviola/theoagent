    "gospel_text": "At that time: John summoned two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to ask, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?' When the men came to Jesus, they said, 'John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, \"Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?\"' At that very time Jesus cured many people of diseases, illnesses, and evil spirits; he also granted sight to many who were blind. And Jesus said to them in reply, 'Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind regain their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the good news proclaimed to them. And blessed is the one who takes no offense at me.'",

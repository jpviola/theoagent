    "gospel_text": "At that time: John summoned two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to ask, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?' When the men came to Jesus, they said, 'John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, \"Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?\"' At that very time Jesus cured many people of diseases, illnesses, and evil spirits; he also granted sight to many who were blind. And Jesus said to them in reply, 'Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind regain their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the good news proclaimed to them. And blessed is the one who takes no offense at me.'",

Most Catholic exegetes favor the patristic view: John knew but wanted his followers to see Jesus' works directly.

      "prayer_prompt": "Lord Jesus, like John I sometimes question and doubt when circumstances are difficult. Help me recognize You in unexpected ways. Open my eyes to see Your work in my life, unstop my ears to hear Your voice, and give me faith to trust Your timing and methods, even when they differ from my expectations. Let me not take offense at Your ways but embrace Your will with joy. Amen."

    "scholars": {
      "ratzinger": "Benedict XVI in 'Jesus of Nazareth' notes that Jesus doesn't give John a direct 'yes' answer but points to His works. Faith must see God's action, not just hear words. The Messianic age is HERE, but not as expected.",
      "hahn": "Scott Hahn emphasizes the connection to Isaiah 35 - this is the 'new exodus' where God leads His people from slavery. Jesus is the new Moses performing signs, but greater signs: healing, not just plagues.",
      "wright": "N.T. Wright argues this passage is crucial for understanding Jesus' self-understanding: He IS the Messiah, but redefines messiahship away from military conquest toward healing, liberation, and good news for the poor."
    },
    
    "liturgical_connection": "This Advent reading prepares us to recognize Jesus at Christmas. Like John, we must look beyond surface expectations and see God's humble, healing presence. The Incarnation is God coming in unexpected lowliness.",
    
    "practical_application": "Today, look for Christ in unexpected places: the suffering person who needs help, the small act of mercy, the quiet moment of grace. Don't demand spectacular signs; recognize His presence in works of love and healing.",

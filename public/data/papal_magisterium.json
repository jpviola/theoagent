These words of Saint Paul resonate through the centuries, reminding us of the personal and intimate love that Christ has for each soul. The devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus is not a peripheral practice in the life of the Church, but rather stands at the very center of our relationship with God, because it leads us to contemplate the infinite love that moved the Word to become flesh and dwell among us.",

The Church Fathers saw in this outpouring from Christ's pierced heart the birth of the Church and the sacraments. From the wounded heart of the Redeemer flow the saving waters of Baptism and the Blood of the Eucharist. This is why devotion to the Sacred Heart is inseparable from sacramental life and from the Church herself.",

To make reparation is to respond with love to the indifference and rejection that Christ continues to suffer. To consecrate is to entrust our whole being to His loving providence.",

    "question": "Why does Jesus seem harsh to the Canaanite woman?",
    "difficulty": "Jesus ignores her, then calls Gentiles 'dogs' - seems cruel and racist!",
    "answer": "This passage is challenging, but understanding the context reveals Jesus' pedagogical method:\n\n**The Harsh Language:** Jesus uses 'dogs' (κυνάριον, kynarion) - actually 'little dogs' or 'puppies,' a diminutive suggesting household pets, not wild scavengers. Still offensive by modern standards, but less harsh in context.\n\n**Jesus' Purpose:** He's teaching His disciples (and us) about:\n1. The priority of Israel in salvation history (Romans 1:16 - 'to the Jew first')\n2. Faith that persists despite obstacles\n3. God's ultimate plan to include Gentiles\n\n**The Woman's Response:** She doesn't dispute being a 'dog' but cleverly turns Jesus' metaphor: even dogs get crumbs from the master's table. This shows:\n- Humility (accepts her position)\n- Faith (knows Jesus has abundance)\n- Wit (engages His teaching method)\n\n**Jesus' Commendation:** 'Great is your faith!' - This is the point. Jesus wasn't being cruel but drawing out and displaying her remarkable faith as an example.\n\n**Scholars Say:**\n- **Benedict XVI:** Jesus' apparent harshness serves to highlight the woman's faith. He's testing and drawing it out, not crushing it.\n- **Scott Hahn:** This foreshadows the Gentile mission. Jesus came first to Israel, but always intended to include all nations.\n- **N.T. Wright:** This is a prophetic enactment - Jesus is showing that Gentile faith will enter God's family through persistence and humility.",

    "question": "Did Jesus really say we must 'hate' our families?",
    "difficulty": "'If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother... he cannot be my disciple' - This contradicts the 4th Commandment!",
    "answer": "This is a classic example of Semitic hyperbole - exaggeration for emphasis, common in Hebrew and Aramaic speech.\n\n**What 'Hate' Means Here:**\n\nThe Greek word μισέω (miseō) can mean:\n1. Absolute hatred (rare in Scripture)\n2. Love less, prefer less (common in Hebrew thought)\n3. Set aside for the sake of something higher\n\nCompare Matthew 10:37 (parallel): 'Whoever loves father or mother MORE THAN ME is not worthy of me.' Luke's 'hate' = Matthew's 'love more than.'\n\n**Old Testament Background:**\n\nGenesis 29:31 - 'Leah was hated' (ESV) or 'unloved' (NIV) - same Hebrew concept. Leah wasn't despised; she was loved less than Rachel.\n\nMalachi 1:2-3 - 'Jacob I loved, Esau I hated' = Jacob was chosen/preferred.\n\n**Jesus' Point:**\n\nDiscipleship requires Christ to be FIRST - supreme loyalty. When family demands conflict with following Christ, He must take priority. This doesn't mean cruelty to family, but proper ordering of loves.\n\n**Catholic Teaching:**\n\n'The disciple of Christ must not only keep the faith but also profess it, spread it, and defend it at the cost of their life' (CCC 1816). This can create family conflicts when relatives oppose faith.\n\n**Scholars Say:**\n- **Joachim Jeremias:** This is deliberate oriental hyperbole - shocking exaggeration to make an unforgettable point.\n- **Joseph Ratzinger:** The family must be seen in light of the Kingdom. Christ doesn't destroy family but transforms it by putting it under God's lordship.\n- **Augustine:** We must love family members, but love God incomparably more - infinitely more.",

    "passage": "Mark 10:18",
    "question": "Does Jesus deny being God when He says 'Why call me good? No one is good except God alone'?",
    "difficulty": "This seems to deny His divinity - if He's God, why refuse 'good'?",
    "answer": "This passage is actually a profound Christological teaching, not a denial of divinity.\n\n**What Jesus Is Doing:**\n\nJesus is using the Socratic method - asking a question to provoke deeper thought. He's challenging the rich young man to consider WHO he's addressing.\n\n**The Logic:**\n1. 'You call me good' (premise)\n2. 'Only God is good' (premise)\n3. Therefore... (unstated conclusion: 'Who am I?')\n\nJesus is leading the man toward the conclusion: 'You're calling me good, but only God is good, so...' - He's inviting recognition of His divinity!\n\n**The Greek:**\n\nThe question is τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν; (ti me legeis agathon) - 'Why do you call me good?' Not 'Don't call me good' but 'Why? Think about what you're saying.'\n\n**Parallel in John:**\n\nJohn 10:11 - 'I am the good shepherd' (ὁ ποιμὴν ὁ καλός). Jesus DOES claim goodness when making divine claims. If He denied being good in Mark, He'd contradict Himself.\n\n**Church Fathers:**\n\n- **St. Ambrose:** Jesus doesn't refuse the title but tests whether the man recognizes who stands before him.\n- **St. John Chrysostom:** This is a gentle way of revealing His divinity without overwhelming the young man.\n- **St. Augustine:** Jesus is teaching that true goodness belongs to God's nature - and inviting the man to see that nature in Him.\n\n**Scholars Say:**\n- **Joseph Ratzinger:** Jesus is educating the man about the true meaning of 'good' - it's not flattery but a divine attribute. Does the man understand what he's saying?\n- **N.T. Wright:** This is pedagogical - Jesus makes people think rather than giving easy answers.",

    "passage": "Mark 3:28-29; Matthew 12:31-32",
    "question": "What is the unforgivable sin? Can I commit it?",
    "difficulty": "'Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven' - Have I done this? Am I damned?",
    "answer": "This is one of the most anxiety-producing passages, but understanding the context brings relief.\n\n**The Context:**\n\nThe Pharisees witnessed Jesus casting out demons by the Holy Spirit's power and deliberately attributed it to Satan (Mark 3:22). They saw manifest good and called it evil - not out of ignorance but malicious rejection.\n\n**What It Is:**\n\n'Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit' is the permanent, deliberate, final rejection of God's grace. It's calling the Holy Spirit (who testifies to Christ) a demon.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n1. **Deliberate** - Not accidental, not in ignorance\n2. **Final** - Persistent refusal to repent unto death\n3. **Against the Light** - Rejecting known truth about God\n4. **Attributed to Satan** - Calling God's work evil\n\n**Why It's 'Unforgivable':**\n\nNot because God won't forgive, but because the person refuses to repent. You can't receive forgiveness if you won't ask for it. As Augustine said: 'It's not that God cannot forgive, but that the sinner will not repent.'\n\n**The Critical Point:**\n\nIF YOU'RE WORRIED YOU'VE COMMITTED IT, YOU HAVEN'T.\n\nWhy? Because worry about sin shows:\n- You're not in final rejection of God\n- The Holy Spirit is still working in your conscience  \n- You desire God's mercy\n- You're capable of repentance\n\nThe unforgivable sin is characterized by hard-hearted impenitence, not by anxious concern about one's spiritual state.\n\n**Aquinas' Insight:**\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologica II-II, Q. 14) says there are six ways to sin against the Holy Spirit: presumption, despair, resisting known truth, envy of another's grace, obstinacy in sin, and final impenitence. The last is the true 'unforgivable' sin - dying in deliberate rejection.\n\n**Scholars Say:**\n- **Joseph Ratzinger:** This sin is possible only as long as one persists in it. Until death, repentance is possible.\n- **Scott Hahn:** The context shows this is rejecting the Holy Spirit's testimony to Christ, not any specific action.\n- **Joachim Jeremias:** The unforgivable sin is the hardening of the heart against God's final revelation in Christ.\n\n**CCC 1864:**\n\n'There are no limits to the mercy of God, but anyone who deliberately refuses to accept His mercy by repenting, rejects the forgiveness of his sins and the salvation offered by the Holy Spirit.'",

    "question": "Why did Jesus destroy the herd of pigs? Isn't that wasteful and cruel to animals?",
    "difficulty": "Jesus lets demons enter 2,000 pigs who then drown - property destruction and animal cruelty?",
    "answer": "This miracle raises modern ethical concerns, but examining it in context reveals deeper meaning.\n\n**The Setting:**\n\nRegion of the Gadarenes - Gentile territory (pigs were unclean to Jews). The possessed men were:\n- Living in tombs (ritually unclean)\n- So violent no one could control them\n- Completely isolated from human society\n\n**Why Pigs?:**\n\n1. **Symbolic Geography:** Pigs in Jewish territory violated Mosaic law. Their presence suggests Jewish violation of Torah or Gentile influence.\n\n2. **Demon Request:** The demons ASKED to enter the pigs (Matthew 8:31). Jesus granted their request, but it resulted in their destruction - showing demonic intent leads to death.\n\n3. **Economic Reality:** The pig herders were likely Jews violating dietary law for profit, or Gentiles in Jewish territory. Either way, an unlawful enterprise.\n\n**The Deeper Meaning:**\n\n**Theological:** Demons bring destruction. When they enter anything - humans or animals - death follows. The pigs' fate shows what demons intended for the men.\n\n**Typological:** Like the scapegoat (Leviticus 16) carrying sins away, the demons are cast out and destroyed. The pigs become unwitting sin-bearers.\n\n**Christological:** Jesus values human life infinitely above animal life and property. Two human souls restored > 2,000 pigs.\n\n**Modern Questions:**\n\n'What about the pigs?'\n- Animals aren't moral agents with eternal souls\n- The pigs' death was caused by demonic possession, not Jesus' cruelty\n- Jesus permitted, not commanded, the demon entry\n\n'What about property rights?'\n- The owners were likely engaging in activity forbidden to Jews\n- Human redemption takes priority\n- Jesus has authority over all creation\n\n**The Townspeople's Response:**\n\nRemarkably, they ask Jesus to LEAVE (v. 34). They valued pigs more than healed humans - Jesus' point exactly. What do we value more: material goods or human souls?\n\n**Scholars Say:**\n- **Benedict XVI:** This shows the hierarchy of value - human persons made in God's image are infinitely precious compared to animals or property.\n- **Scott Hahn:** The demons' request and the pigs' destruction reveal Satan's true intent: destruction. The men were spared this fate.\n- **Origen:** The pigs represent unclean passions that must be drowned/destroyed for human liberation.",

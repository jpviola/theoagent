This is not three gods (tritheism) nor one Person with three modes (modalism), but three Persons sharing one divine essence. The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, yet there are not three gods but one God. Each Person is fully God, possessing the same divine nature, yet they are distinct in their relations to one another: the Father eternally begets the Son, the Son is eternally begotten of the Father, and the Holy Spirit eternally proceeds from the Father and the Son.\n\n<key_points>\n1. One God in three Persons: The divine nature is undivided and shared equally by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\n2. Each Person is fully divine: Not three parts of God, but three Persons who each possess the fullness of divinity\n3. Distinct but inseparable: The Persons are distinguished by their relations of origin, yet all divine works are accomplished by all three Persons working as one\n4. A mystery beyond full comprehension: While revealed by Christ and comprehensible in part, the Trinity ultimately transcends human understanding\n</key_points>\n</explanation>\n\n<citations>\n[Source: CCC 232] \"Christians are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: not in their names, for there is only one God, the almighty Father, his only Son and the Holy Spirit: the Most Holy Trinity.\"\n\n[Source: CCC 234] \"The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of Christian faith and life. It is the mystery of God in himself. It is therefore the source of all the other mysteries of faith, the light that enlightens them.\"\n\n[Source: CCC 253] \"The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three persons, the consubstantial Trinity.\"\n\n[Source: CCC 254] \"The divine persons do not share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God whole and entire.\"\n\n[Source: Matthew 28:19] \"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\"\n</citations>\n\n<practical_application>\nUnderstanding the Trinity shapes our entire spiritual life. We pray to the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit. When we make the Sign of the Cross, we profess our faith in the Trinity. Our baptism initiated us into the life of the three divine Persons. In prayer, we can address each Person individually while recognizing their perfect unity. The Trinity also reveals that God is a communion of love—Father, Son, and Spirit eternally loving one another—and we are called to participate in this divine life of love through grace. This mystery assures us that we worship a God who is not solitary but relational, and who invites us into relationship with Him.\n</practical_application>\n</answer>"}]}

This is not three gods (tritheism) nor one Person with three modes (modalism), but three Persons sharing one divine essence. The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, yet there are not three gods but one God. Each Person is fully God, possessing the same divine nature, yet they are distinct in their relations to one another: the Father eternally begets the Son, the Son is eternally begotten of the Father, and the Holy Spirit eternally proceeds from the Father and the Son.\n\n<key_points>\n1. One God in three Persons: The divine nature is undivided and shared equally by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\n2. Each Person is fully divine: Not three parts of God, but three Persons who each possess the fullness of divinity\n3. Distinct but inseparable: The Persons are distinguished by their relations of origin, yet all divine works are accomplished by all three Persons working as one\n4. A mystery beyond full comprehension: While revealed by Christ and comprehensible in part, the Trinity ultimately transcends human understanding\n</key_points>\n</explanation>\n\n<citations>\n[Source: CCC 232] \"Christians are baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: not in their names, for there is only one God, the almighty Father, his only Son and the Holy Spirit: the Most Holy Trinity.\"\n\n[Source: CCC 234] \"The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity is the central mystery of Christian faith and life. It is the mystery of God in himself. It is therefore the source of all the other mysteries of faith, the light that enlightens them.\"\n\n[Source: CCC 253] \"The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three persons, the consubstantial Trinity.\"\n\n[Source: CCC 254] \"The divine persons do not share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God whole and entire.\"\n\n[Source: Matthew 28:19] \"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\"\n</citations>\n\n<practical_application>\nUnderstanding the Trinity shapes our entire spiritual life. We pray to the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit. When we make the Sign of the Cross, we profess our faith in the Trinity. Our baptism initiated us into the life of the three divine Persons. In prayer, we can address each Person individually while recognizing their perfect unity. The Trinity also reveals that God is a communion of love—Father, Son, and Spirit eternally loving one another—and we are called to participate in this divine life of love through grace. This mystery assures us that we worship a God who is not solitary but relational, and who invites us into relationship with Him.\n</practical_application>\n</answer>"}]}

Jesus is not half-God and half-man, nor is He a divine Person merely dwelling in a human person. Rather, He is one Person (the Second Person of the Trinity) who possesses two complete natures—divine and human—which remain distinct yet are perfectly united in His one Person. As God, Jesus possesses all divine attributes: He is eternal, omnipotent, omniscient in His divine knowledge, and the Creator of all things. As man, Jesus has a true human body, a rational human soul, human emotions, human will, and human knowledge (which could grow and develop). He experienced hunger, thirst, fatigue, suffering, and death. Yet these two natures are united in one Person, so everything Jesus does can be attributed to the one Person who is both God and man.\n\n<key_points>\n1. Jesus is fully divine—true God: He possesses the complete divine nature from all eternity, is consubstantial with the Father, and is the Second Person of the Trinity\n2. Jesus is fully human—true man: He possesses a complete human nature with body and rational soul, experienced authentic human life, emotions, growth, suffering, and death\n3. Not half-God and half-man but 100% both: Each nature retains its properties and neither is diminished or mixed with the other\n4. Two natures united in one Person (hypostatic union): The union occurs at the level of Person (hypostasis), not by mixing or confusing the natures\n</key_points>\n\n<heresies_addressed>\nThroughout history, various heresies have denied aspects of this teaching: Arianism denied Christ's full divinity, claiming He was a created being. Docetism denied His true humanity, claiming He only appeared human. Nestorianism divided Christ into two persons. Monophysitism confused the two natures into one mixed nature. The Church definitively rejected all these errors at the early ecumenical councils, especially Chalcedon (451 AD).\n</heresies_addressed>\n</explanation>\n\n<citations>\n[Source: CCC 464] \"The unique and altogether singular event of the Incarnation of the Son of God does not mean that Jesus Christ is part God and part man, nor does it imply that he is the result of a confused mixture of the divine and the human. He became truly man while remaining truly God. Jesus Christ is true God and true man.\"\n\n[Source: CCC 466] \"The Nestorian heresy regarded Christ as a human person joined to the divine person of God's Son. Opposing this heresy, St. Cyril of Alexandria and the third ecumenical council, at Ephesus in 431, confessed that the Word, uniting to himself in his person the flesh animated by a rational soul, became man.\"\n\n[Source: CCC 470] \"Because 'human nature was assumed, not absorbed', in the mysterious union of the Incarnation, the Church was led over the course of centuries to confess the full reality of Christ's human soul, with its operations of intellect and will, and of his human body.\"\n\n[Source: Council of Chalcedon, 451] \"Following the holy Fathers, we unanimously teach to confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity, truly God and truly man... consubstantial with the Father in divinity, and consubstantial with us in humanity... acknowledged in two natures without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.\"\n\n[Source: John 1:14] \"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\"\n</citations>\n\n<practical_application>\nThis doctrine matters immensely for our salvation. Because Jesus is fully God, His sacrifice has infinite value and can truly save us from sin. Because He is fully human, He can represent us before God and truly experience our suffering—He is not a distant God but one who knows what it means to be human. As our mediator, He bridges the gap between divinity and humanity in His very Person. In prayer, we can bring our human struggles to Jesus knowing He genuinely understands human experience. When we suffer, we know God Himself has experienced suffering in Christ. This mystery also assures us that human nature is good and capable of union with God—what Christ assumed, He redeemed and elevated.\n</practical_application>\n</answer>"}]}
